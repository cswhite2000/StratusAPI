# Anax

##### This Plugin is in development and not suitable to use on a server yet!
## Background

This plugin is being developed for the purpose of creating an efficient and user friendly work environment for [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/en/) map makers.

## Why is it called Anax?
Inspired by [Plastix](https://github.com/Plastix)'s Agloe, it was decided that this project should also have a name with some meaning behind it. Agloe is the name of a fictional town put onto a map as a copyright trap. More information [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agloe,_New_York). Anax is short for Anaximander - a Greek philosopher credited with being the first to publish a map of the world. Learn more about Anaximander [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander).
